<p style="font-size: 12px;">

The file contains the schema for "Employees_42".

It's crucial to acknowledge that the table names in the examples contain underscores and numbers, unlike the naming conventions in LeetCode problems. In MySQL, all LeetCode problems are stored in a single database, resulting in potential duplicate table names. Thus, when using the code, it's essential to use the correct table names to prevent errors due to naming disparities.
